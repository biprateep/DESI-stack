# DESI-stack

Code development for a stacking algorithm for DESI spectra. Code base eventually to be moved to `desihub/desigal`.

To use this developmental version of the package add the following to your code.

```python
import sys
sys.path.insert(0,'local/path/to/DESI-stack/py/')

#after the above, modules can be imported in the usual fashion.
from desigal import sky, utils
```
